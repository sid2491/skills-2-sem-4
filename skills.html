    <p>- I am a perceptive communicator with the capacity to engage, compel and liaise with colleagues, executives and external stakeholders.</p>
    <!-- <br></br>   -->
    <p>- I pride myself on the high-level problem-solving skills I have used in all roles to overcome adversity and guarantee efficiencies in my team.</p> 

    <p>- Being adaptable and flexible has enabled me to challenge conventional ways of working and learn new and more efficient languages.</p>

    <p>- While I enjoy working independently, I thrive when working in team. Iâ€™m excited about working effectively with others to achieve common goals.</p>

    <p>- React calmly to any problem or situation in order to handle it properly for the best results.</p>
